//PRARIK JAIN (HOW TO MAKE NOTES.)
a. in life we make the DSA NOTES AND WE LEARN DSA IN ONE TIME ONLY one time and afterwards our life is easy.
    -> in future we learn the MACHINE LEARNING or DEVLOPMENT then this notes are userful.
    -> for INTERVIEW 'quick revision' we required DSA NOTEs.
    -> when we switch company then this notes are useful.

b. NOW WE SEE 5 METHODS TO MAKE EFFECTIVE NOTES.
    1. we requied the PEN AND PAPER and GITHUB.our code is present in GITHUB and THOUGHT PROCESS present at PEN
       PAPER.
    2. TYPES OF NOTES.
        -> CONCEPTUAL NOTES.(detailed notes.)
        ->PROBLEM SOLVING NOTES.(clean and crisp)

    3. CONCEPTUAL NOTES.(detailed notes.)
        i. when we read new concept then after some THEORY , DRY THE HARD PROBLEM AND LEARN. (for eamample
        when we learn RECURSION then see the HARD PROBLEM and DRY RUN code likewise)
    
    4. PROBLEM SOLVING NOTES.(clean and crisp)
        (AFTER SOLVING PROBLEM THEN MOVE TO THE NOTES)
        i. after solve problem then three important things.
            ->write down APPROACHES (e.g. DP,RECURSION,etc)
            ->write down "to the point" TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY.
            -> CORNER CASES(try it for the negative cases, incresing order.): write down the corner cases and
             if we found the SPECIAL CASE then DRY RUN this for FUTURE.
            -> UPLOAD ON GITHUB or DRIVE.

    5. MAKE INDEXING FOR NOTES AS WELL AS THE GITHUB CODE.
