// difference in the  String final_S = new String(); and String final =""; in java

Absolutely, let's break it down in simpler terms:

**String final_S = new String();**:
Imagine you have a box, and you want to put something inside it. When you say `new String()`, it's like making a brand new box, even if you don't have anything special to put inside. So, you end up with an empty box that you created just for the sake of it. This can be a bit wasteful because you have an extra, unnecessary box.

**String final = "";**:
Now, think about having a special magic box that's always empty. When you say `""`, it's like pointing to that magic box and saying, "I want to use this box, and it's already empty." You didn't create a new box; you're just using the one that's always available. This is smarter because you're reusing a box that you know is empty, and you're not wasting space on unnecessary boxes.

In simple words, using `String final = "";` is like using a magic empty box you already have, and it's a clever way to save space. Using `String final_S = new String();` is like making a new empty box, even though you don't really need it. So, the first way is better because it's efficient and doesn't waste memory.
