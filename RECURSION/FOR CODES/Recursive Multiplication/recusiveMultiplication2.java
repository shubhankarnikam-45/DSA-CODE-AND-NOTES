  Swapping the values of `n` and `m` when `n` is less than `m` in the given recursive method (`multiply(n, m)`) doesn't necessarily provide a benefit in terms of computation or efficiency. Instead, it's a technique used to ensure that the larger value is always assigned to `n` and the smaller value to `m` before the recursive calculations are performed. This adjustment is made to maintain consistency and simplify the recursive logic.

In the context of the provided recursive multiplication method, swapping `n` and `m` when `n` is less than `m` achieves the following:

1. **Consistency**: Swapping ensures that regardless of the order in which `n` and `m` are provided as arguments, the algorithm consistently treats the larger value as `n`. This makes it easier to reason about how the recursion is working and simplifies the base and recursive cases.

2. **Simplified Recursive Logic**: By ensuring that `n` is always greater than or equal to `m`, the recursive logic doesn't need to account for cases where `m` might be larger than `n`. This simplifies the logic and avoids unnecessary branching.

3. **Avoiding Negative Values**: Swapping prevents negative values from being passed to the recursive calls. If `n` and `m` are swapped and `m` becomes negative, the recursive multiplication would end naturally without going into a potentially infinite recursion.

In summary, the swapping technique in this particular recursive multiplication implementation is used for clarity and simplicity in handling the recursion, ensuring that the larger value is consistently treated as `n` to simplify the logic and avoid issues with negative values. It's not about efficiency, but rather about maintaining a clear and reliable recursive process.
