1. focus on one programming language rather multiple language.
2. not stuck in one data structure or algorithm 
    see the use case when we move forwar.
        TREE ==> RECURSION
        STACK & QUEUE ==> LINKED List
        GRAPHS ==> STACK & QUEUE
    
    * Their is only 20-25 average quetion solved for the each Data structure and algorithm
    * after completing the 4-5 month then we also solve the dsa quetions.

3. RUSH TO SOLVING PROBLEM
    * when solving the problem then not give too small time or too much time.
    * if quetion is not solved then the see the solution and BOOKMAKR FOR REVISON.
    * when we SOLVE  the prblem now it is time to SEE OTHER SOLUTION. AND LEARN FROM that
      SOLUTION. 
    * don't COMPARE with OTHER'S.

4. AFTER LEARING THE DSA FOR 5-6 MONTHS THEN DOT'S LEAVE.
    * if you leave after learning the you regret after 6 months.
    * solve RANDOM QUETIONS., participate in CONTEST , 

5. STUCK ON THE ONE RESOURCES.
    * follow path of one resouces. 
    * neigther you will be the hamper.

6. DON'T GIVE UP.
    * now if we ARRIVE IN THE DSA and if we want to become the GOOD SDE then it must.
      to doing for the 6 months.
    * OUTPUT IS VERY AMAZING FOCUS ON INPUT
