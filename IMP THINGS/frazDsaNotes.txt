1. make CLEAN & CRISP notes.
2. when we UNDERSTANDING  the ALGORITHEM then MEMORIZING is much MORE EASY ==> CODE THIS ALGORITHM.
3. IN NOTES WE HAVE TO INCLUDE only NEW THING.

4. now their are four important thing to know.
    a.  CODE: 
        when you code then must TIME COMPLEXITY, SPACE COMPLEXITY AND COMMENTS.
    b. COMMENTS:
        in COMMENTS we must write the IN WHICH KIND WE WRITE THE ALGORITHM , WHICH IS 
        EXAMPLE WE TAKE, FOR WHAT REASON WE PICK UP THIS DATA STRUCTURE.
        
    c. EXAMPLE OF ALGORITHEM: 
    * after ALGORITHM we must take EXAMPLE for the CODE-FORCE, LEETCODE, CODE-STUDIO
    * hence we REVISE the ALGORITHM in different way by DOING QUETION WE UNDERSTAND 
      ALGORITHM. 
    
    d. RIVISE ONCE IN MONTH

5. by using this notes we will more CONFIDENT DURING INTERVIEW(try to use before 1-2 days)
   before INTERVIEW.
